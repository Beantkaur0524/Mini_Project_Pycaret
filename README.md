# Mini_Project_Pycaret
A mini machine-learning project for Customer Churn Prediction using PyCaret. The project includes data preprocessing, automated model comparison, and evaluation. A Linear Regression model is also applied as a simple baseline to observe its behavior on churn data. 

# 🚀 Project Highlights

- Automated ML pipeline using PyCaret Classification

- Data cleaning, preprocessing & categorical encoding handled automatically

- Logistic Regression applied as one of the main models

- Evaluation using:

  - Confusion Matrix

  - ROC & AUC curves

- Streamlit UI for interactive model visualization
